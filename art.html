            <h3>Infinity Mirrors</h3>
            <p>This is one effect I find particularly interesting because it is quite simple to build, even in real life, but the result is quite fascinating.</p>

            <p>This is an image I rendered just for the creation of this website. I'd just finished modelling a new Koenigsegg Jesko, so I was inspired to make a new render.</p>

            <h3>Glass of Gingerale</h3>
            <p>I was inspired by a friend's work to challenge myself to render the same scene as photorealistically as I could at the time.  Now, I see even more details I could improve on.</p>

            <p>This is a render made for my <a href="https://ahs3n.ml">prototype website</a>. This is a very short 20 frame animation running at 60fps. As a result, the file is very small, and serves as the loading screen. If you look closely you'll see that every tree is identical, allowing for the seamless yet short loop.</p>
