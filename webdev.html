            <h3>VLC Credits</h3>
            <p>Two years in a row, I worked on a miniature economy/banking system for my school, called "<a href="https://vlc-credits.01000001.repl.co/login">VLC Credits</a>".  t was available to students and staff for a period of one week. During this time, despite the best efforts of some of my friends, they were unsuccessful in finding any vulnerabilities in the system. The modern looking CSS was a bonus. The background is randomly selected from a set of shaders I coded. Each one evolves slowly over time.</p>

            <h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
            <p>This is a very long <a href="https://ahs3n.ml">project</a> I have been working on. My goal is to create an entire digital island from scratch. The purpose of this, is to serve as proof of my knowledge  and what I can do with it, which could help potential employers understand the range and depth of my skills.</p>

            <h3>Paradigm AR Speaker Display</h3>
            <p>This <a href="https://01000001khan.github.io/AR-Speakers/">website</a> was the first real HTML project I ever worked on.  I developed this website while working at Paradigm Electronics Inc. to serve as a small demonstration of AR modelâ€™s functionality for potential customers. It eventually expanded to include models of several speaker series, each of which I optimized by hand to be small enough to load and function on a mobile device.</p>
